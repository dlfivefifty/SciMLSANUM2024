# We now consider the solution of time-evolution ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using the
# DifferentialEquations.jl framework. An important feature is the ability to
# use automatic-differentiation with the numerical solutions, allowing us to solve
# simple nonlinear equations or optimisation problems involving parameters or initial conditions in the ODEs.

# **Learning Outcomes**

# ## 4.1 Solving ODEs with DifferentialEquations.jl

# DifferentialEquations.jl is a powerful framework for solving many different types of equations with
# many different types of solves, including stochastic differential equations, retarded differential equations,
# mixed discrete-continuous equations, PDEs,  and more. Here we will focus on the simplest case of second-order
# time-evolution ODEs, beginning with the classic pendulum equation.


# Consider again the pendulum equation with friction
# $$
# u'' = œÑ u' - \sin u
# $$
# which we rewrite as a first order system:
# $$
# \begin{bmatrix}
#    u' \\
#    v'
#    \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v \\ -œÑ*v - \sin u \end{bmatrix}
# $$
# We can represent the right-hand side of this equation as a function that writes to a
# `du` vector (thus avoiding allocations) as follows:

function pendulum_rhs!(du, ùêÆ, œÑ, t)
    u,v = ùêÆ
    du[1] = v
    du[2] = -sin(u) - œÑ*v
end

# Here `œÑ` plays the role of a parameter: for fast time-stepping its essential that we know the types
# at compile time and hence its much better to pass in a parameter than refer to a global variable.
# We can now construct a representation of the ODE problem as follows:

œÑ = 0.0 # no friction
T = 10.0 # final time
u‚ÇÄ, v‚ÇÄ = 1,1 # initial conditions for poistion and velocity
prob = ODEProblem(pendulum_rhs!, [u‚ÇÄ, v‚ÇÄ], (0.0, T), œÑ)

# DifferentialEquations.jl has many diferent time-steppers, we will use a simple one based on
# an explicit Runge‚ÄìKutta method (a more efficient analogue of ode45 in Matlab):

sol = solve(prob, Tsit5(), abstol = 1e-10, reltol = 1e-10)
plot(sol)

# Because we have access to automatic differentiation, we can also easily use implicit methods
# (even though they aren't needed here):

sol = solve(prob, Rodas4(), abstol = 1e-10, reltol = 1e-10)
plot(sol)

# ------

# **Problem 1** Approximate  a solution to the predator-prey model
# $$
# \begin{bmatrix} x' \\ y' \end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix}Œ±x - Œ≤xy \\  Œ¥xy - Œ≥y\end{bmatrix}
# $$
# on $T ‚àà [0,10]$ with $Œ± , Œ≤,Œ¥,Œ≥ = 1,2,3,4$ with initial condition $[1,2]$.

    ## TODO: Implement the right-hand side for the predator prey model
    ## SOLUTION
    x,y = ùêÆ

# ## 4.2 Combining auto-differentiation with DifferentialEquations.jl

# The combination of automatic-differentiation and time-stepping allows for differentiating
# with respect to parameters through an actual solve. For forward-mode automatic differentiation 
# this is intuitive: the values at each time-step are now dual numbers. Here we see a simple
# example using ForwardDiff.jl. Consider the problem of choosing a friction so at the end time
# the pendulum is at the bottom (but not necessarily stationary). We can set this up as follows,
# where for simplicity we hard-code the initial conditions as $[1,1]$:


function pendulum_friction(œÑ)
    T = 10.0 # final time
    u‚ÇÄ, v‚ÇÄ = 1,1 # initial conditions
    prob = ODEProblem(pendulum_rhs!, [u‚ÇÄ, v‚ÇÄ], (0.0, T), œÑ)
    solve(prob, Vern9(), abstol = 1e-10, reltol = 1e-10) # Vern9 is an explicit Runge-Kutta method
end

pendulum_friction_stop(œÑ) = pendulum_friction(œÑ)[end][1] # find the value of u at the final time

pendulum_friction_stop(0.1) # value at T = 10 with friction equal to 0.1

# We can immediately differentiate with respect to `œÑ`:

using ForwardDiff
ForwardDiff.derivative(pendulum_friction_stop, 0.1)

# Behind the scenes this is running the time-stepper with dual numbers. We can use this in a simple newton iteration to, for example, find the friction
# that results in a desired end conditon:


œÑ = 0.1
for k = 1:10
    œÑ = œÑ - ForwardDiff.derivative(pendulum_friction_stop, œÑ) \ pendulum_friction_stop(œÑ)
end
œÑ, pendulum_friction_stop(œÑ)

# We see that it has successed in finding one such friction so that we end 
# up at the bottom at the final time:

plot(pendulum_friction(œÑ))

# ------

# **Problem 2** We can also differentiate with respect to the initial conditions.
# Find an initial velocity such that the pendulum is at the bottom at $T = 10$ with
# no friction, assuming $u(0) = 1$.

## TODO: Setup a function taking in the initial velocity and find the initial velocity so we end at rest.
## SOLUTION
function pendulum_initialvelocity(v‚ÇÄ)
    T = 10.0 # final time
    prob = ODEProblem(pendulum_rhs!, [1, v‚ÇÄ], (0.0, T), 0)
    solve(prob, Vern9(), abstol = 1e-10, reltol = 1e-10) # Vern9 is an explicit Runge-Kutta method
end

pendulum_initialvelocity_stop(v‚ÇÄ) = pendulum_initialvelocity(v‚ÇÄ)[end][1]

v0 = 1.0
for k = 1:10
    v0 = v0 - ForwardDiff.derivative(pendulum_initialvelocity_stop, v0) \ pendulum_initialvelocity_stop(v0)
end
v0, pendulum_initialvelocity_stop(v0)

plot(pendulum_initialvelocity(v0))
## END


# **Problem 3** We can also compute gradients and Jacobians through solves using
# forward-mode autmatic differentiation. For the predator and prey model, fix $Œ± = Œ≥ = 1$
# and initial conditions $x(0) = 1$, $y(0) = 2$.
# Use automatic differentiation with vector Newton iteration  to choose
# choose $Œ≤,Œ¥$ so that $x(10) = y(10) = 1$.


## TODO: find the parameters in predator and prey to reach the desired end condition
## SOLUTION 
function predatorprey(Œ≤Œ≥)
    Œ≤,Œ≥ = Œ≤Œ≥
    T = 10.0 # final time
    prob = ODEProblem(predatorprey_rhs!, [1, 2], (0.0, T), (1,Œ≤,Œ≥,1))

# ## 4.3 Automatic-differentiation of ODEs with Zygote.jl

# Zygote.jl also works with automatic differentation, but it requires another package: SciMLSensitivity.
# Here is an example of computing the derivative. The catch is its more restrictive: it requires that
# the parameters are specified by a vector:


using Zygote, SciMLSensitivity

function pendulum_rhs_zygote!(du, ùêÆ, œÑv, t)
    u,v = ùêÆ
    œÑ = œÑv[1]
    du[1] = v
    du[2] = -sin(u) - œÑ*v
end    

function pendulum_friction_zygote(œÑ)
    T = 10.0 # final time
    u‚ÇÄ, v‚ÇÄ = 1.0,1 # initial conditions
    prob = ODEProblem(pendulum_rhs_zygote!, [u‚ÇÄ, v‚ÇÄ], (0.0, T), [œÑ])
    solve(prob, Vern9(), abstol = 1e-10, reltol = 1e-10) # Vern9 is an explicit Runge-Kutta method
end

pendulum_friction_zygote_stop(œÑ) = pendulum_friction_zygote(œÑ)[end][1] # find the value of u at the final time


@test pendulum_friction_zygote_stop'(0.1) ‚âà ForwardDiff.derivative(pendulum_friction_stop, 0.1)


# Now one might ask: how is Zygote.jl computing the derivative with reverse-mode automatic differentiation
# when `pendulum_rhs_zygote!` is modifying the input, something we said is not allowed? The answer: its not.
# Or more specifically: its computing the derivative (and indeed the pullback) using forward-mode automatic differentation.
# But we can still use it for efficiently computing gradients and optimising.

# Here is an example where we allow for a piecewise-constant frictions and optimise so the final solution
# has roughly the same position and velocity as we started with. We first setup the problem and show we can
# compute gradients:



function pendulum_rhs_zygote!(du, ùêÆ, œÑs, t)
    u,v = ùêÆ
    œÑ = œÑs[max(1,ceil(Int, 10t))]
    du[1] = v
    du[2] = -sin(u) - œÑ*v
end    

function pendulum_friction_vec(œÑs)
    T = 10.0 # final time
    u‚ÇÄ, v‚ÇÄ = 1.0,1 # initial conditions
    prob = ODEProblem(pendulum_rhs_zygote!, [u‚ÇÄ, v‚ÇÄ], (0.0, T), œÑs)
     solve(prob, Vern9(), abstol = 1e-10, reltol = 1e-10) # Vern9 is an explicit Runge-Kutta method
end

## We include an extra unused argument for parameters.
pendulum_friction_loss(œÑs, _) = norm(pendulum_friction_vec(œÑs)[end] .- 1) # find the value of u at the final time

## We can compute the gradient
@time gradient(pendulum_friction_loss, randn(100), ())

# This can then be used an optimisation:

using Optimization, OptimizationOptimisers
prob = OptimizationProblem(OptimizationFunction(pendulum_friction_loss, Optimization.AutoZygote()), randn(100), ())
@time ret = solve(prob, Adam(0.03), maxiters=100)
plot(pendulum_friction_vec(ret.u))
